<h1>The Seekers - Georgy Girl</h1>
<p>Hey there! Georgy girl
Swinging down the street so fancy free,
Nobody you meet could ever see
The loneliness there inside you.</p>
<p>Hey there! Georgy girl
Why do all the boys just pass you by?
Could it be you just don't try,
  Or is it the clothes you wear?</p>
