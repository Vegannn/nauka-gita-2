<h1>The Seekers - Georgy Girl<br></h1>
<p>Hey there! Georgy girl<br>
Swinging down the street so fancy free,<br>
Nobody you meet could ever see<br>
The loneliness there inside you.<br><br></p>
<p>Hey there! Georgy girl<br>
Why do all the boys just pass you by?<br>
Could it be you just don't try,<br>
Or is it the clothes you wear?<br><br></p>
<p>Hey there! Georgy girl<br>
There's another Georgy deep inside<br>
Bring out all the love you hide<br>
And, oh, what a change there'd be,<br>
The world would see a new Georgy girl.<br><br></p>
